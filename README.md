# RSA_Cryptography_project
The aim of this project is to give you a hands-on understanding of the importance and
applicability of discrete mathematics in computer science.
Public key cryptosystems known as the RSA system. RSA cryptosystem is based
on the dramatic difference between the ease of finding large primes and the
difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers (the integer
factorization problem).
In this project, you have to write an implementation for the RSA cryptosystem in a
console mode of Java.
